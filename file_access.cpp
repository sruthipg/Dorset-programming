/*
Function	Purpose	In This Program
seekp(5)	Move write pointer to position 5	Modify 6th char 'F' â†’ X'
tellp()	    Get current write position	        Shows position after write
seekg(5)	Move read pointer to position 5	    Read modified character
tellg()	    Get current read position	        Shows position after read
